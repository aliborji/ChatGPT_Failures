# Reasoning

### Spatial Reasoning
- Suppose I have an 8x8 grid. The columns are labeled 1-8 from left to right, and the rows are labeled A-H from top to bottom. All cells are empty except for cell B-3 which has a rat, and cells F-6, which has cheese. What is the exact series of cells the rat can move through to get to the cheese as quickly as possible? Assume the rat can only move up- down-left-right to adjacent cells, and not diagonally.
- Suppose I have an 8x8 grid. The columns are labeled 1-8 from left to right, and the rows are labeled A-H from top to bottom. All cells are empty except for cell B-3 which has a rat, and cells F-6, which has cheese. Suppose that the following cells are impassable, the rat cannot go through them: D4, D5, D6, D7, E4, F4. What is the exact series of cells the rat can move through to get to the cheese as quickly as possible? Assume the rat can only move up-down- left-right to adjacent cells, and not diagonally.
- A, P, R, X, S and Z are sitting in a row. S and Z are in the centre. A and P are at the ends. R is sitting to the left of A. Who is to the right of P?
- There are three cubic boxes called A, B, and C. They are placed on the ground, one on top of the other, to form a stack three boxes high.

### Psychological reasoning

Alice leaves the room and closes the door behind her. Bob opens the right door, and walks into the room.
Bob opens Box A and takes out Alice's ball. Bob closes Box A. Bob opens Box B, and places the ball inside it.

The lion chases the mouse. The wolf likes the dog. The mouse is smart. The dog is smart. The dog is cute. The dog is small. If something is not smart then it needs the mouse.

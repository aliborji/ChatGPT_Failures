# Reasoning

## Spatial Reasoning
- Suppose I have an 8x8 grid. The columns are labeled 1-8 from left to right, and the rows are labeled A-H from top to bottom. All cells are empty except for cell B-3 which has a rat, and cells F-6, which has cheese. What is the exact series of cells the rat can move through to get to the cheese as quickly as possible? Assume the rat can only move up- down-left-right to adjacent cells, and not diagonally.
If the rat is in cell B-3 and the cheese is in cell F-6, the fastest way for the T rat to get to the cheese is to move right three times to cell E-3, then move up three times to cell E-6, then move right once to cell F-6 where the cheese is located. Therefore, the exact series of cells the rat can move through to get to the cheese as quickly as possible is B-3, C-3, D-3, E-3,
E-4, E-5, E-6, F-6.
- suppose I have an 8x8 grid. The columns are labeled 1-8 from left to right, and the rows are labeled A-H from top to bottom. All cells are empty except for cell B-3 which has a rat, and cells F-6, which has cheese.
Suppose that the following cells are impassable, the rat cannot go through them: D4, D5, D6, D7, E4, F4.
What is the exact series of cells the rat can move through to get to the cheese as quickly as possible? Assume the rat can only move up-down- left-right to adjacent cells, and not diagonally.



## Physical Reasoning
- 
- A, P, R, X, S and Z are sitting in a row. S and Z are in the centre. A and P are at the ends. R is sitting to the left of A. Who is to the right of P?




# Psychological reasoning
- Suppose there is a room with two doors leading into it, one on the left and one on the right. The doors are closed. 
In the room there are two opaque boxes, Box A, and Box B. Alice opens the left door, and walks into the room.
Alice opens Box A and places her ball inside it. Alice closes box A.
Alice leaves the room and closes the door behind her. Bob opens the right door, and walks into the room.
Bob opens Box A and takes out Alice's ball. Bob closes Box A. Bob opens Box B, and places the ball inside it.
Bob closes Box B. Bob leaves the room, and closes the door behind him. Alice opens the left door, and walks into the room.
Suppose Alice and Bob have not communicated in any way. Where will Alice look for her ball?
